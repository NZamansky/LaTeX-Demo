\newpage

This is a document written in \LaTeX.

Notice how it is really pretty.

%This is a comment.
There is a comment above this line, but you can't see it because it is preceded with a \%. To type that, I had to type \textbackslash \%. Don't ask how I did that. (You have to type \textbackslash textbackslash. It's weird, I know.)

Commenting is useful, because reasons.

You can do really nice looking equations!

\begin{equation}
  e = m \cdot c^2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  {a^2 + b^2} = \frac{c \cdot c}{(e \cdot c)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \sqrt[3]{a^2 + b^2} = {c \cdot c \over (e \cdot c)}
\end{equation}

Text {_{subtext}} {^{supertext}}

\begin*{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^n
\end{equation}
